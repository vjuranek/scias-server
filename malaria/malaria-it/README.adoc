= Running the tests

== In memory tests
To run tests with default in-memory DB (H2), simply run 

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean verify
----
No prerequisites are required and these tests run by default.

== Tests with PostgreSQL
Running the tests against PostgreSQL completely simulates production environment.
These tests don't run by default and to run them seccessfuly assumes that PostgreSQL is running and database schema (and other config. like authetication) is properly set up.
To run the tests agains PostgreSQL, use profile `postgres`:
[source, shell]
----
mvn clean verify -Ppostgres
----
